The [cavoe's osu! event's Global Taiko Showdown](https://gratiaproductions.com/coegts/home) has been a tournament that showcased its strengths into providing some of the most interesting tournament action in osu!taiko back in 2023, while being its first ever LAN tournament as well, and being the only tournament in the game with, truly, **100% original content.**

So, there is no better way to end GTS than with this tournament.

Regarding the tournament's bracket format, there is a slight change from the past year. This is planned to be a **single-elimination bracket** of **8 players** that will be in the tournament following the online Qualifiers, which will be streamed, due to the nature of the songs in this mappool.

As a special event as well this year, the **Qualifier Results** will be showcased at COE itself, along with the **Main Mappool Showcase.** 

The tournament's detailed schedule and all relevant info for participating can be found below.
